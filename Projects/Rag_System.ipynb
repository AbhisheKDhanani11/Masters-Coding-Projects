Nichols \\nComplaint \\nKeysight Technologies, Inc. \\n(‘‘Keysight’’) and Spirent \\nCommunications plc (‘‘Spirent’’) are two \\nof the largest global providers of three \\nkey types of communications testing \\nand measurement equipment—high \\nspeed ethernet testing, network security \\ntesting, and radio frequency (‘‘RF’’) \\nchannel emulators—and are significant \\ndirect competitors in the United States. \\nKeysight’s proposed acquisition of \\nSpirent threatens to substantially lessen \\ncompetition and harm customers in \\nviolation of Section 7 of the Clayton \\nAct, 15 U.S.C. 18. It should be enjoined \\nto avoid harm to competition. \\nI. Nature of the Action \\n1. Communications networks connect \\nthe world, moving significant volumes \\nof data around the clock. Keysight and \\nSpirent provide critical, highly- \\nspecialized equipment used to test \\nvarious components of communications \\nnetworks and measure and validate \\nnetwork performance. Network \\nequipment manufacturers, \\ncommunications network operators, and \\nlarge cloud computing providers \\npurchase and use this specialized \\ntesting equipment to ensure their \\nproducts and networks operate \\neffectively and securely under normal \\nconditions, and to prepare them to \\nwithstand the real-world strain of \\ninterruptions, cyberattacks, interference, \\nand high user demand. Because \\ncommunications technologies are \\nrapidly evolving, the communications \\nindustry invests millions of dollars \\nannually in researching, developing, \\nand implementing upgrades to their \\nproducts to keep pace with \\ntechnological advancement. \\n2. Together, Keysight and Spirent \\ndominate three testing and \\nmeasurement markets in the United \\nStates: high-speed ethernet testing, \\nnetwork security testing, and RF \\nchannel emulators. Keysight and \\nSpirent are each other’s closest \\ncompetitors in these markets. For years, \\ncompetition between them has resulted \\nin each company offering discounts, \\nmaintaining valuable aftermarket \\nsupport services, and investing in new \\nand advanced products and features— \\nall to the benefit of their customers and \\nthe broader public. Keysight’s proposed \\nacquisition of Spirent would eliminate \\nthis competition, leading to higher \\nprices; lower quality products, support, \\nand service; and less innovation. \\nII. Defendants and the Proposed \\nTransaction \\n3. Keysight is a Delaware corporation \\nwith its headquarters in Santa Rosa, \\nCalifornia. It reported $4.979 billion in \\nglobal revenues in 2024, $1.769 billion \\nof which were from the United States. \\nKeysight’s Communications Solutions \\nGroup produces and sells the products \\nin the relevant markets at issue. The \\nCommunications Solutions Group \\nincludes two main areas: (i) commercial \\ncommunications and (ii) aerospace, \\ndefense and government. \\n4. Spirent is a United Kingdom \\ncorporation headquartered in Crawley, \\nEngland, with offices in Calabasas, \\nCalifornia and other locations in and \\noutside the United States. It earned $460 \\nmillion in global revenues in 2024, $257 \\nmillion of which were from the United \\nStates. \\n5. On March 28, 2024, Keysight \\noffered to purchase Spirent for $1.5 \\nbillion. Spirent’s board recommended \\nthat Spirent shareholders accept \\nKeysight’s offer, which they did on May \\n22, 2024. \\nIII. Jurisdiction and Venue \\n6. The United States brings this action \\npursuant to Section 15 of the Clayton \\nAct, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 25, to \\nprevent and restrain Keysight and \\nSpirent from violating Section 7 of the \\nClayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18. \\n7. Both Keysight and Spirent are \\ncorporations that transact business \\nwithin this District through, among \\nother things, their sales of \\ncommunications testing and \\nmeasurement products. \\n8. Defendants Keysight and Spirent \\nare engaged in a regular, continuous, \\nand substantial flow of interstate \\ncommerce and their sales have a \\nsubstantial effect on interstate \\ncommerce, including within this \\nDistrict. The Court has subject-matter \\njurisdiction pursuant to Section 15 of \\nthe Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \\n25, and 28 U.S.C. 1331, 1337(a), and \\n1345. \\n9.

Venue is \\nproper in this district under Section 12 \\nof the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 22 and 28 \\nU.S.C. 1391. \\nIV. Background \\n10. Communications networks link \\ntogether different entities and devices, \\nreferred to as ‘‘endpoints,’’ to enable the \\nexchange of information between them. \\nCommunications networks include \\ncomputer networks in a large enterprise \\norganization; telecommunications \\nnetworks that power mobile phones; \\nsatellite networks that enable GPS- \\nenabled devices; and cloud-computing \\nnetworks that store and transmit vast \\nquantities of data. These endpoints can \\nbe connected via hardwire (e.g., optical \\nfiber/copper) or wirelessly using radio \\nspectrum. Today, a complex system of \\ninterconnected and separate networks \\nallow consumers to store, access, and \\nmove data across the world. \\n11. The communications industry \\nuses specialized testing equipment to \\nverify the performance of \\ncommunications networks and the \\ndevices connected to them. This testing \\nis essential to validate that a network \\nperforms as expected, even under non- \\nideal conditions, such as conditions that \\ninterfere with a wireless signal, or to \\nensure that networks and equipment \\ncan handle increasing loads of traffic. \\nTesting also helps ensure that user data \\nis securely protected against the threat \\nof cyberattack. To complete this testing, \\nequipment manufacturers and network \\noperators purchase specialized \\nhardware and software equipment, and \\nthey rely on periodic software updates \\nand multi-year services contracts to \\nprovide regular maintenance and system \\nupgrades. \\n12. High-speed ethernet testing, \\nnetwork security testing, and RF \\nchannel emulators are used in a lab \\nenvironment to test network elements \\nbefore they are deployed in the field. \\nLab testing equipment is complex, \\ncostly, and relatively fixed. By contrast, \\nequipment used to test networks and \\ndevices already in operation—known as \\nlive testing equipment—is generally \\nmore portable and less expensive than \\nlab testing equipment. \\n13. Customers use lab testing \\nequipment throughout the lifecycle of a \\nnetwork, even after the network or \\ndevices in it have been deployed. Lab \\ntesting ensures that communications \\nnetworks can support updated devices, \\ncomply with revised industry standards, \\nand maintain data security as the \\ncybersecurity landscape changes. \\n14. Lab testing equipment requires \\nconstant engineering investment. \\nNetwork technology changes rapidly: \\ndata moves faster, mobile wireless \\nproviders deploy new spectrum and \\nnew wireless technologies, would-be \\nhackers develop new lines of attack, and \\ndevice manufacturers make each \\niteration of their product more \\nsophisticated. Lab testing equipment \\nproviders, including Keysight and \\nSpirent, spend millions of dollars each \\nyear on research and development to \\nensure their products keep pace with \\nmarket changes and employ hundreds of \\nspecialized experts dedicated to \\nimproving their testing equipment and \\nresponding to customer requests. \\n15. Accurate lab testing capabilities \\nare critical to the development, \\nvalidation, and maintenance of wireline \\nand wireless communications devices \\nand networks. A wide range of \\ncustomers depend on specialized lab \\ntesting equipment to successfully \\ndeploy their networks and devices, \\nincluding network equipment \\nmanufacturers, network operators, \\nchipset manufacturers, ‘‘hyperscalers’’ \\nthat offer cloud computing services, \\nresearch labs, government testing \\ncenters, and large companies operating \\nsecure internal networks. Equipment \\ncannot be effectively deployed in these \\ncomplex networks without such testing. \\nV. Relevant Markets \\n16. Each of the three product markets \\nidentified below constitutes a line of \\ncommerce as that term is used in \\nSection 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \\n18, and each is a relevant product \\nmarket in which competitive effects can \\nbe assessed. The geographic market for \\neach relevant product market is \\ncomprised of sales to customers within \\nthe United States. \\nA. High-Speed Ethernet Testing \\nEquipment \\n17. High-speed ethernet testing \\nequipment tests the performance of both \\nthe hardware and software components \\nof high-speed wireline communications \\nnetworks. Specifically, it tests the \\nfunctionality of communications both \\nwithin a given network and across \\ndifferent networks. This testing ensures \\nthat wireline networks can support \\nhigh-bandwidth use cases, such as \\nrunning artificial intelligence \\nalgorithms. These testing products are \\ncrucial to ensure that large network \\noperators can support data usage at \\nscale. \\n18. Customers using high-speed \\nethernet testing equipment have no \\nreasonable alternatives for testing their \\nwireline network equipment. Solutions \\ndeveloped in-house or relying on open- \\nsource software would not provide an \\nadequate alternative for most customers. \\nAttempting to use such options would \\nrequire costly investments in \\nengineering and other technical \\nresources, can take years to develop, \\nand would not be as reliable or robust \\nas the high-speed ethernet testing \\nequipment available from Keysight or \\nSpirent. \\n19. A hypothetical monopolist could \\nprofitably impose a small but significant \\nand non-transitory price increase for, or \\notherwise degrade quality of, high-speed \\nethernet testing equipment customers in \\nthe United States. A degradation of \\nquality could entail any dimension of \\ncompetition, including service, capacity \\ninvestment, choice of product variety or \\nfeatures, or innovation. Accordingly, \\nhigh-speed ethernet testing equipment \\nsold to U.S. customers constitutes a \\nrelevant market and line of commerce \\nunder Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 \\nU.S.C. 18. \\nB. Network Security Testing Equipment \\n20. Network security testing \\nequipment assesses the cybersecurity of \\nwireline networks through laboratory \\nsimulation of attacks, testing firewalls as \\nwell as other security-related features \\nlike proxy and secure content gateways. \\nThese products simulate real-world \\nconditions, such as high traffic volumes, \\nto ensure that a network’s security \\npolicies protect it from attack without \\nimpacting performance. \\n21. Customers that purchase network \\nsecurity testing equipment have no \\nreasonable alternatives. Although some \\ncompanies make use of open-source \\nsoftware or internally developed tools \\nfor limited purposes, self-supply is not \\na viable option for most customers due \\nto the high costs involved. Customers \\nrely on network security testing \\nequipment to ensure sensitive data are \\nprotected from cyberattacks, and they \\nare thus unlikely to rely on unproven \\nand untested solutions in the ordinary \\ncourse of business. \\n22. A hypothetical monopolist could \\nprofitably impose a small but significant \\nand non-transitory price increase for, or \\notherwise degrade the quality of, \\nnetwork security testing equipment \\noffered to customers in the United \\nStates. A quality degradation could \\nentail any dimension of competition, \\nincluding service, capacity investment, \\nchoice of product variety or features, or \\ninnovation. Accordingly, network \\nsecurity testing equipment sold to U.S. \\ncustomers constitutes a relevant market \\nand line of commerce under Section 7 \\nof the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18. \\nC.

Wireless networks transmit data \\nusing radio frequency spectrum. \\nWireless communication networks are \\nused across multiple important \\nindustries, including cellular networks, \\nsatellite networks, and radar and \\nnavigation systems. Unlike in a wireline \\nenvironment, signal transmission \\nthrough radio frequency can be subject \\nto substantial interference from weather, \\nlarge objects, topographical features, \\nand the presence of other competing \\nradio signals. \\n24. RF channel emulators, also known \\nas ‘‘faders,’’ are used in a lab setting. \\nThey test whether wireless receivers, \\nsuch as cell phones or radar handsets, \\ncan effectively receive and decode RF \\nsignals. A channel emulator adds \\nvarious impairments to the intended \\ncommunication path to simulate real- \\nworld challenges, such as dense urban \\nsettings, mountainous regions, or long \\ndistances. This performance testing \\nenables engineers to adjust and optimize \\ndesigns in a controlled environment to \\nensure wireless networks perform as \\nexpected once they are deployed. \\n25. Customers that purchase RF \\nchannel emulators have no reasonable \\nalternatives. Although some companies \\nmake use of open-source software or \\ninternally developed tools for limited \\npurposes, self-supply is not a viable \\noption for most customers due to the \\nhigh costs and technical expertise \\nrequired to develop internal solutions. \\nCustomers rely on RF channel emulators \\nto ensure networks will operate \\neffectively in real-world conditions. \\n26. A hypothetical monopolist could \\nprofitably impose a small but significant \\nand non-transitory price increase for, or \\notherwise degrade the quality of, RF \\nchannel emulators sold to customers in \\nthe United States. A degradation of \\nquality could entail any dimension of \\ncompetition, including quality, service, \\ncapacity investment, choice of product \\nvariety or features, or innovation. \\nAccordingly, RF channel emulators sold \\nto U.S. customers constitutes a relevant \\nmarket and line of commerce under \\nSection 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \\n18. \\nVI. Anticompetitive Effects \\n27. Keysight and Spirent are the \\ndominant providers of high-speed \\nethernet testing equipment, network \\nsecurity testing equipment, and RF \\nchannel emulators in the United States. \\nTheir proposed merger would \\nextinguish the competition between \\nthem and would presumptively result in \\na substantial lessening of competition in \\neach market. \\n28. The transaction would \\nsubstantially lessen competition in the \\nmarket for high-speed ethernet testing \\nequipment in the United States. \\nKeysight and Spirent are the two \\nprincipal suppliers of high-speed \\nethernet testing equipment in the \\nUnited States and have remained the \\nmarket leaders in this area for many \\nyears. In the United States, Keysight and \\nSpirent have a combined market share \\nof approximately 85%. The market for \\nhigh-speed ethernet testing equipment \\nis already highly concentrated and \\nwould become significantly more \\nconcentrated as a result of the proposed \\nmerger. \\n29. Keysight and Spirent compete \\ndirectly against one another to provide \\nhigh-speed ethernet testing equipment \\nto customers. The handful of other \\nmarket participants serve far fewer \\ncustomers and offer much less robust \\ntechnical solutions than Defendants do. \\nCustomers have benefited from \\ncompetition between Defendants \\nthrough lower prices, higher quality \\nservices, and more robust innovation— \\nan essential feature as technology and \\nnetwork hardware testing components \\ncontinuously evolve to meet and enable \\ncustomer innovations. \\n30. The transaction also would \\nsubstantially lessen competition in the \\nmarket for network security testing \\nequipment in the United States. \\nKeysight and Spirent are the two largest \\nsuppliers of network security testing \\nequipment in the United States and \\nhave remained the market leaders in \\nthis market for many years. In this \\nmarket, each Defendant earns more than \\ndouble the revenue of any other \\ncompetitor; together, Keysight and \\nSpirent would have a combined market \\nshare of at least 60% in the United \\nStates. The market for network security \\ntesting equipment is already highly \\nconcentrated and would become \\nsignificantly more concentrated after the \\nproposed merger. \\n31. Keysight and Spirent compete \\nhead-to-head to provide network \\nsecurity testing equipment to customers. \\nThis competition has resulted in lower \\nprices, higher-quality services, and \\nfaster product improvements. These \\nupdates are essential to keep pace as \\ncybersecurity attackers develop \\nincreasingly more sophisticated \\nmethods of accessing secure networks. \\n32. The transaction also would \\nsubstantially lessen competition in the \\nmarket for RF channel emulators in the \\nUnited States. Keysight and Spirent are \\ntwo of the leading providers of RF \\nchannel emulators in the United States, \\nwith a combined market share of more \\nthan 50%. The market for RF channel \\nemulators is already highly \\nconcentrated and would become \\nsignificantly more concentrated after the \\nproposed merger. \\n33. Keysight and Spirent compete \\nhead-to-head to provide RF channel \\nemulators to customers. This \\ncompetition has resulted in lower \\nprices, higher-quality services, and \\nrobust product improvements. These \\nupdates are essential to keep pace as \\ntechnology improves and wireless \\nnetworks are used for increasingly more \\ndata traffic. \\n34. Keysight and Spirent are \\nespecially close competitors for \\ncustomers who use RF channel \\nemulators to test terrestrial wireless \\nnetworks (as opposed to satellite \\nnetworks) and for customers who need \\n‘‘external’’ hardware-based faders able \\nto test a full array of RF channel \\nemulation capabilities. Other providers \\nof RF channel emulators only support \\nsatellite networks and/or only emulate \\nsimple interference with ‘‘internal’’ \\nsoftware-based products. Keysight and \\nSpirent are the only providers in the \\nUnited States of RF channel emulators \\ncapable of supporting the full array of \\ntest environments for terrestrial wireless \\nnetworks. For U.S. customers that \\nrequire these capabilities, Keysight and \\nSpirent are the only options. \\nVII. Absence of Countervailing Factors \\n35. It is unlikely that any firm would \\nenter the relevant markets in a timely \\nmanner sufficient to prevent the \\nproposed transaction’s anticompetitive \\neffects. Successful entry into these \\nspecialized markets is difficult, time- \\nconsuming, and costly. \\n36. A prospective entrant would need \\nto invest significant time and capital to \\ndesign and develop testing products \\ncomparable to the Defendants’ product \\nlines. In each of the relevant markets, \\nKeysight and Spirent have spent \\nmillions of dollars and many years \\nacquiring, building, and refining their \\nproducts. Moreover, the underlying \\ncommunications technologies are \\ngoverned by evolving standards, \\nrequiring substantial ongoing \\ninvestment to ensure that a new product \\nfunctions effectively with new features \\nand meets new standards. Finally, given \\nthat these products impact the \\nperformance, security, and reliability of \\nnetworks that handle sensitive data, a \\nprospective entrant would need to \\ndevote significant resources to \\ndemonstrate its ability to provide a \\nhigh-quality product and high-quality \\nservice and support, including regular \\nupdates.

If Defendants have not divested the \\nDivestiture Assets within the period \\nspecified in Paragraph IV.A, Defendants \\nmust immediately notify the United \\nStates of that fact in writing.

After the appointment of a \\ndivestiture trustee by the Court, only the \\ndivestiture trustee will have the right to \\nsell those Divestiture Assets that the \\ndivestiture trustee has been appointed \\nto sell. The divestiture trustee will have \\nthe power and authority to accomplish \\nthe divestiture to Acquirer, at a price \\nand on terms obtainable through \\nreasonable effort by the divestiture \\ntrustee, subject to the provisions of \\nSections IV, V and VI of this Final \\nJudgment, and will have other powers \\nas the Court deems appropriate. The \\ndivestiture trustee must sell the \\nDivestiture Assets as quickly as \\npossible. \\nC.

Enforcement of Final Judgment \\nA. If any time during the five-year \\nperiod following entry of this Final \\nJudgment, the United States determines \\nat its sole discretion that the Final \\nJudgment has failed to fully redress the \\nviolations alleged in the Complaint, \\nthen the United States may re-open this \\nproceeding to seek additional relief, \\nincluding divestiture of additional \\nassets. Such additional relief may be \\nordered by this Court upon a finding by \\na preponderance of the evidence that \\nthere is a reasonable probability that the \\nproposed Final Judgment did not fully \\nredress the violations alleged in the \\nComplaint. \\nB. The United States retains and \\nreserves all rights to enforce the \\nprovisions of this Final Judgment, \\nincluding the right to seek an order of \\ncontempt from the Court.

This Final Judgment should be \\ninterpreted to give full effect to the \\nprocompetitive purposes of the antitrust \\nlaws and to restore the competition the \\nUnited States alleges was harmed by the \\nchallenged conduct. Defendants agree \\nthat they may be held in contempt of, \\nand that the Court may enforce, any \\nprovision of this Final Judgment that, as \\ninterpreted by the Court in light of these \\nprocompetitive principles and applying \\nordinary tools of interpretation, is stated \\nspecifically and in reasonable detail, \\nwhether or not it is clear and \\nunambiguous on its face. In any such \\ninterpretation, the terms of this Final \\nJudgment should not be construed \\nagainst either party as the drafter. \\nD. In an enforcement proceeding in \\nwhich the Court finds that Defendants \\nhave violated this Final Judgment, the \\nUnited States may apply to the Court for \\nan extension of this Final Judgment, \\ntogether with other relief that may be \\nappropriate. In connection with a \\nsuccessful effort by the United States to \\nenforce this Final Judgment against a \\nDefendant, whether litigated or resolved \\nbefore litigation, that Defendant agrees \\nto reimburse the United States for the \\nfees and expenses of its attorneys, as \\nwell as all other costs including experts’ \\nfees, incurred in connection with that \\neffort to enforce this Final Judgment, \\nincluding in the investigation of the \\npotential violation. \\nE. For a period of four (4) years \\nfollowing the expiration of this Final \\nJudgment, if the United States has \\nevidence that a Defendant violated this \\nFinal Judgment before it expired, the \\nUnited States may file an action against \\nthat Defendant in this Court requesting \\nthat the Court order: (1) Defendant to \\ncomply with the terms of this Final \\nJudgment for an additional term of at \\nleast four (4) years following the filing \\nof the enforcement action; (2) all \\nappropriate contempt remedies; (3) \\nadditional relief needed to ensure the \\nDefendant complies with the terms of \\nthis Final Judgment; and (4) fees or \\nexpenses as called for by this Section \\nXV. \\nXVI. Expiration of Final Judgment \\nUnless the Court grants an extension, \\nthis Final Judgment will expire ten (10) \\nyears from the date of its entry, except \\nthat after five (5) years from the date of \\nits entry, this Final Judgment may be \\nterminated upon notice by the United \\nStates to the Court and Defendants that \\nthe divestiture has been completed and \\ncontinuation of this Final Judgment is \\nno longer necessary or in the public \\ninterest. \\nXVII.

Nichols \\nCompetitive Impact Statement \\nIn accordance with the Antitrust \\nProcedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. \\n16(b)–(h) (the ‘‘APPA’’ or ‘‘Tunney \\nAct’’), the United States of America files \\nthis Competitive Impact Statement \\nrelated to the proposed Final Judgment \\nfiled in this civil antitrust proceeding. \\nI. Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding \\nOn March 28, 2024, Keysight \\nTechnologies Inc. (‘‘Keysight’’) offered \\nto acquire Spirent Communications plc \\n(‘‘Spirent’’) for approximately $1.5 \\nbillion, and Spirent’s shareholders \\nvoted to accept this offer on May 22, \\n2024. The United States filed a civil \\nantitrust Complaint on June 2, 2025, \\nseeking to enjoin the proposed \\nacquisition. The Complaint alleges that \\nthe likely effect of this acquisition \\nwould be to substantially lessen \\ncompetition for the development, \\nmanufacture, and sale of three key types \\nof communications testing and \\nmeasurement equipment—high-speed \\nethernet testing equipment, network \\nsecurity testing equipment, and \\nradiofrequency (‘‘RF’’) channel \\nemulators—to customers in the United \\nStates, in violation of Section 7 of the \\nClayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18. \\nAt the same time the Complaint was \\nfiled, the United States filed a proposed \\nFinal Judgment and an Asset \\nPreservation and Hold Separate \\nStipulation and Order (‘‘Stipulation and \\nOrder’’), which are designed to remedy \\nthe loss of competition alleged in the \\nComplaint. \\nUnder the proposed Final Judgment, \\nwhich is explained more fully below, \\nDefendants are required to divest the \\nidentified Divestiture Assets in each of \\nthe three Divestiture Businesses where \\ncompetitive harm is alleged. The \\nDivestiture Businesses are high-speed \\nethernet testing, network security \\ntesting, and RF channel emulators, as \\ndetailed in the proposed Final \\nJudgment. These assets must be divested \\nto a third-party acquirer approved by \\nthe United States. Viavi Solutions, Inc. \\nhas already entered into an agreement \\nwith Defendants to acquire the \\nDivestiture Assets and is an approved \\nacquirer, and divestiture could also be \\nmade to an alternative acquirer if \\napproved by the United States. \\nThe Stipulation and Order requires \\nDefendants to take certain steps to \\npreserve competition and to ensure the \\ncompetitiveness of the Divestiture \\nAssets pending entry of final judgment \\nby this Court. Specifically, Defendants \\nmust operate, preserve, and maintain \\nthe Divestiture Assets as ongoing, \\neconomically fully viable, marketable, \\nand competitive assets until the \\nrequired divestiture is complete. In \\naddition, management, sales, and \\noperations of Divestiture Assets must be \\nheld entirely separate, distinct, and \\napart from Defendants’ other operations. \\nThe Stipulation and Order also provides \\nfirewalls to ensure Keysight cannot \\naccess competitively sensitive \\ninformation from the Divestiture \\nBusinesses. \\nThe United States and Defendants \\nhave stipulated that the proposed Final \\nJudgment may be entered after \\ncompliance with the APPA. Entry of the \\nproposed Final Judgment will terminate \\nthis action, except that the Court will \\nretain jurisdiction to construe, modify, \\nor enforce the provisions of the \\nproposed Final Judgment and to punish \\nviolations thereof. \\nII. Description of Events Giving Rise to \\nthe Alleged Violation \\nA. The Defendants and the Proposed \\nTransaction \\nKeysight is a Delaware corporation \\nheadquartered in Santa Rosa, California. \\nIt is a leading provider of \\ncommunications testing and \\nmeasurement equipment in the U.S. and \\nworldwide. Keysight’s fiscal year 2024 \\nglobal revenues were approximately \\n$4.979 billion, $1.769 billion of which \\nwere from the United States. Keysight’s \\nCommunications Solutions Group \\nproduces and sells the products in the \\nrelevant markets at issue. The \\nCommunications Solutions Group \\nincludes two main areas: (i) commercial \\ncommunications and (ii) aerospace, \\ndefense and government. \\nSpirent is a United Kingdom \\ncorporation headquartered in Crawley, \\nEngland, with offices in Calabasas, \\nCalifornia and other locations in and \\noutside the United States. It is also a \\nleading provider of communications \\ntesting and measurement equipment in \\nthe U.S. and worldwide. Spirent earned \\n$460 million in global revenues in 2024, \\n$257 million of which were from the \\nUnited States. \\nOn March 28, 2024, Keysight offered \\nto purchase Spirent for $1.5 billion. \\nSpirent’s board recommended that \\nSpirent shareholders accept Keysight’s \\noffer, which they did on May 22, 2024. \\nB. The Competitive Effects of the \\nTransaction \\nKeysight and Spirent provide critical, \\nhighly-specialized equipment used to \\ntest various components of \\ncommunications networks and measure \\nand validate network performance. \\nTogether, they dominate three key \\ncommunications testing and \\nmeasurement markets in the United \\nStates: high-speed ethernet testing, \\nnetwork security testing, and RF \\nchannel emulators. Keysight and \\nSpirent are each other’s closest \\ncompetitors in these markets. For years, \\ncompetition between them has resulted \\nin each company offering discounts, \\nmaintaining valuable aftermarket \\nsupport services, and investing in new \\nand advanced products and features— \\nall to the benefit of their customers and \\nthe broader public. Keysight’s proposed \\nacquisition of Spirent would eliminate \\nthis competition, leading to higher \\nprices; lower quality products, support, \\nand service; and less innovation. \\n1. Industry Overview \\nCommunications networks connect \\nthe world, moving significant volumes \\nof data around the clock. The \\ncommunications industry uses \\nspecialized testing equipment to verify \\nthe performance of communications \\nnetworks and the devices connected to \\nthem. This testing is essential to \\nvalidate that a network performs as \\nexpected, even under non-ideal \\nconditions, such as conditions that \\ninterfere with a wireless signal, or to \\nensure that networks and equipment \\ncan handle increasing loads of traffic. \\nTesting also helps ensure that user data \\nis securely protected against the threat \\nof cyberattack. To complete this testing, \\nequipment manufacturers and network \\noperators purchase specialized \\nhardware and software equipment, and \\nthey rely on periodic software updates \\nand multi-year services contracts to \\nprovide regular maintenance and system \\nupgrades. \\nNetwork equipment manufacturers, \\ncommunications network operators, and \\nlarge cloud computing providers \\npurchase and use this specialized \\ntesting equipment to ensure their \\nproducts and networks operate \\neffectively and securely under normal \\nconditions, and to prepare them to \\nwithstand the real-world strain of \\ninterruptions, cyberattacks, interference, \\nand high user demand. Because \\ncommunications technologies are \\nrapidly evolving, the communications \\nindustry invests millions of dollars \\nannually in researching, developing, \\nand implementing upgrades to their \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:13 Jun 11, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4703 E:\\\\FR\\\\FM\\\\12JNN2.SGM 12JNN2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES2'),\n",

Lab testing ensures \\nthat communications networks can \\nsupport updated devices, comply with \\nrevised industry standards, and \\nmaintain data security as the \\ncybersecurity landscape changes. \\nLab testing equipment requires \\nconstant engineering investment. \\nNetwork technology changes rapidly: \\ndata moves faster, mobile wireless \\nproviders deploy new spectrum and \\nnew wireless technologies, would-be \\nhackers develop new lines of attack, and \\ndevice manufacturers make each \\niteration of their product more \\nsophisticated. Lab testing equipment \\nproviders, including Keysight and \\nSpirent, spend millions of dollars each \\nyear on research and development to \\nensure their products keep pace with \\nmarket changes and employ hundreds of \\nspecialized experts dedicated to \\nimproving their testing equipment and \\nresponding to customer requests. \\nAccurate lab testing capabilities are \\ncritical to the development, validation, \\nand maintenance of wireline and \\nwireless communications devices and \\nnetworks. A wide range of customers \\ndepend on specialized lab testing \\nequipment to successfully deploy their \\nnetworks and devices, including \\nnetwork equipment manufacturers, \\nnetwork operators, chipset \\nmanufacturers, ‘‘hyperscalers’’ that offer \\ncloud computing services, research labs, \\ngovernment testing centers, and large \\ncompanies operating secure internal \\nnetworks. Equipment cannot be \\neffectively deployed in these complex \\nnetworks without such testing. \\n2. Relevant Markets Affected by the \\nProposed Acquisition \\nThe Complaint alleges likely harm to \\ncompetition in three distinct product \\nmarkets within the communications \\ntesting and measurement industry: (1) \\nhigh-speed ethernet testing; (2) network \\nsecurity testing; and (3) radiofrequency \\n(‘‘RF’’) channel emulation. \\na. High-Speed Ethernet Testing \\nHigh-speed ethernet testing \\nequipment tests the performance of both \\nthe hardware and software components \\nof high-speed wireline communications \\nnetworks. Specifically, it tests the \\nfunctionality of communications both \\nwithin a given network and across \\ndifferent networks. This testing ensures \\nthat wireline networks can support \\nhigh-bandwidth use cases, such as \\nrunning artificial intelligence \\nalgorithms. These testing products are \\ncrucial to ensure that large network \\noperators can support data usage at \\nscale. \\nCustomers using high-speed ethernet \\ntesting equipment have no reasonable \\nalternatives for testing their wireline \\nnetwork equipment. Solutions \\ndeveloped in-house or relying on open- \\nsource software would not provide an \\nadequate alternative for most customers. \\nAttempting to use such options would \\nrequire costly investments in \\nengineering and other technical \\nresources, can take years to develop, \\nand would not be as reliable or robust \\nas the high-speed ethernet testing \\nequipment available from Keysight or \\nSpirent. A hypothetical monopolist \\ncould profitably impose a small but \\nsignificant and non-transitory price \\nincrease for, or otherwise degrade \\nquality of, high-speed ethernet testing \\nequipment sold to customers in the \\nUnited States. A degradation of quality \\ncould entail any dimension of \\ncompetition, including service, capacity \\ninvestment, choice of product variety or \\nfeatures, or innovation. Accordingly, \\nhigh-speed ethernet testing equipment \\nsold to U.S. customers constitutes a \\nrelevant market and line of commerce \\nunder Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 \\nU.S.C. 18. \\nb. Network Security Testing \\nNetwork security testing equipment \\nassesses the cybersecurity of wireline \\nnetworks through laboratory simulation \\nof attacks, testing firewalls as well as \\nother security-related features like proxy \\nand secure content gateways. These \\nproducts simulate real-world \\nconditions, such as high traffic volumes, \\nto ensure that a network’s security \\npolicies protect it from attack without \\nimpacting performance. \\nCustomers that purchase network \\nsecurity testing equipment have no \\nreasonable alternatives. Although some \\ncompanies make use of open-source \\nsoftware or internally developed tools \\nfor limited purposes, self-supply is not \\na viable option for most customers due \\nto the high costs involved. Customers \\nrely on network security testing \\nequipment to ensure sensitive data are \\nprotected from cyberattacks and are thus \\nunlikely to rely on unproven and \\nuntested solutions in the ordinary \\ncourse of business. A hypothetical \\nmonopolist could profitably impose a \\nsmall but significant and non-transitory \\nprice increase for, or otherwise degrade \\nquality of, network security testing \\nequipment sold to customers in the \\nUnited States. A quality degradation \\ncould entail any dimension of \\ncompetition, including service, capacity \\ninvestment, choice of product variety or \\nfeatures, or innovation. Accordingly, \\nnetwork security testing equipment sold \\nto U.S. customers constitutes a relevant \\nmarket and line of commerce under \\nSection 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \\n18. \\nc. RF Channel Emulation \\nRF channel emulators evaluate how \\nwireless networks and devices will react \\nwhen deployed in the real world, where \\na wireless signal may not be perfect. \\nWireless networks transmit data using \\nradio frequency spectrum. Wireless \\ncommunication networks are used \\nacross multiple important industries, \\nincluding cellular networks, satellite \\nnetworks, and radar and navigation \\nsystems. Unlike in a wireline \\nenvironment, signal transmission \\nthrough radio frequency can be subject \\nto substantial interference from weather, \\nlarge objects, topographical features, \\nand the presence of other competing \\nradio signals. RF channel emulators, \\nalso known as ‘‘faders,’’ are used in a \\nlab setting. They test whether wireless \\nreceivers, such as cell phones or radar \\nhandsets, can effectively receive and \\ndecode RF signals. A channel emulator \\nadds various impairments to the \\nintended communication path to \\nsimulate real-world challenges, such as \\ndense urban settings, mountainous \\nregions, or long distances. This \\nperformance testing enables engineers to \\nadjust and optimize designs in a \\ncontrolled environment to ensure \\nwireless networks perform as expected \\nonce they are deployed. \\nCustomers that purchase RF channel \\nemulators have no reasonable \\ncompetitive alternatives. Although some \\ncompanies make use of open-source \\nsoftware or internally developed tools \\nfor limited purposes, self-supply is not \\na viable option for most customers due \\nto the high costs and technical expertise \\nrequired to develop internal solutions. \\nCustomers rely on RF channel emulators \\nto ensure networks will operate \\neffectively in real-world conditions. A \\nhypothetical monopolist could \\nprofitably impose a small but significant \\nand non-transitory price increase for, or \\notherwise degrade quality of, RF \\nchannel emulators sold to customers in \\nthe United States. A degradation of \\nquality could entail any dimension of \\ncompetition, including quality, service, \\ncapacity investment, choice of product \\nvariety or features, or innovation. \\nAccordingly, RF channel emulators sold \\nto U.S. customers constitutes a relevant \\nmarket and line of commerce under \\nSection 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \\n18. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:13 Jun 11, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4703 E:\\\\FR\\\\FM\\\\12JNN2.SGM 12JNN2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES2'),\n",

Anticompetitive Effects \\nKeysight and Spirent are the \\ndominant providers of high-speed \\nethernet testing equipment, network \\nsecurity testing equipment, and RF \\nchannel emulators in the United States. \\nTheir proposed merger would \\nextinguish the competition between \\nthem and would presumptively result in \\na substantial lessening of competition in \\neach market. \\na. High-Speed Ethernet Testing \\nThe transaction would substantially \\nlessen competition in the market for \\nhigh-speed ethernet testing equipment \\nin the United States. Keysight and \\nSpirent are the two principal suppliers \\nof high-speed ethernet testing \\nequipment in the United States and \\nhave remained the market leaders in \\nthis area for many years. In the United \\nStates, Keysight and Spirent have a \\ncombined market share of \\napproximately 85%. The market for \\nhigh-speed ethernet testing equipment \\nis already highly concentrated and \\nwould become significantly more \\nconcentrated as a result of the proposed \\nmerger. \\nKeysight and Spirent compete directly \\nagainst one another to provide high- \\nspeed ethernet testing equipment to \\ncustomers. The handful of other market \\nparticipants serve far fewer customers \\nand offer much less robust solutions \\nthan Defendants do. Customers have \\nbenefited from competition between \\nDefendants through lower prices, higher \\nquality services, and more robust \\ninnovation—an essential feature as \\ntechnology and network hardware \\ntesting components continuously evolve \\nto meet and enable customer \\ninnovations. \\nb. Network Security Testing \\nThe transaction also would \\nsubstantially lessen competition in the \\nmarket for network security testing \\nequipment. Keysight and Spirent are the \\ntwo largest suppliers of network \\nsecurity testing equipment in the United \\nStates and have remained the market \\nleaders for many years. In this market, \\neach Defendant earns more than double \\nthe revenue of any other competitor; \\ntogether, Keysight and Spirent would \\nhave a combined market share of at least \\n60% in the United States. The market \\nfor network security testing equipment \\nis already highly concentrated and \\nwould become significantly more \\nconcentrated after the proposed merger. \\nKeysight and Spirent compete head- \\nto-head to provide network security \\ntesting equipment to customers. This \\ncompetition has resulted in lower \\nprices, higher-quality services, and \\nfaster product improvements. These \\nupdates are essential to keep pace as \\ncybersecurity attackers develop \\nincreasingly more sophisticated \\nmethods of accessing secure networks. \\nc. RF Channel Emulation \\nThe transaction also would \\nsubstantially lessen competition in the \\nmarket for RF channel emulators in the \\nUnited States. Keysight and Spirent are \\ntwo of the leading providers of RF \\nchannel emulators in the United States, \\nwith a combined market share of more \\nthan 50%. The market for RF channel \\nemulators is already highly \\nconcentrated and would become \\nsignificantly more concentrated after the \\nproposed merger. \\nKeysight and Spirent compete head- \\nto-head to provide RF channel \\nemulators to customers. This \\ncompetition has resulted in lower \\nprices, higher-quality services, and \\nfaster product improvements. These \\nupdates are essential to keep pace as \\ntechnology improves and wireless \\nnetworks are used for increasingly more \\ndata traffic. \\nKeysight and Spirent are especially \\nclose competitors for customers who use \\nRF channel emulators to test terrestrial \\nwireless networks (as opposed to \\nsatellite networks) and for customers \\nwho need ‘‘external’’ hardware-based \\nfaders able to test a full array of RF \\nchannel emulation capabilities. Other \\nproviders of RF channel emulators only \\nsupport satellite networks and/or only \\nemulate simple interference with \\n‘‘internal’’ software-based products. \\nKeysight and Spirent are the only \\nproviders in the United States of RF \\nchannel emulators capable of \\nsupporting the full array of test \\nenvironments for terrestrial wireless \\nnetworks. For U.S. customers that \\nrequire these capabilities, Keysight and \\nSpirent are their only options. \\n4. Barriers to Entry and Expansion \\nIt is unlikely that any firm would \\nenter the relevant markets in a timely \\nmanner sufficient to prevent the \\nproposed transaction’s anticompetitive \\neffects. Successful entry into these \\nspecialized markets is difficult, time- \\nconsuming, and costly. \\nA prospective entrant would need to \\ninvest significant time and capital to \\ndesign and develop testing products \\ncomparable to the Defendants’ product \\nlines. In each of the relevant markets, \\nKeysight and Spirent have spent \\nmillions of dollars and many years \\nacquiring, building, and refining their \\nproducts. Moreover, the underlying \\ncommunications technologies are \\ngoverned by evolving standards, \\nrequiring substantial ongoing \\ninvestment to ensure that a new product \\nfunctions effectively with new features \\nand meets new standards. Finally, given \\nthat these products impact the \\nperformance, security, and reliability of \\nnetworks that handle sensitive data, a \\nprospective entrant would need to \\ndevote significant resources to \\ndemonstrate its ability to provide a \\nhigh-quality product and high-quality \\nservice and support, including regular \\nupdates. Purchasers of high-speed \\nethernet lab testing equipment, network \\nsecurity testing equipment, and RF \\nchannel emulators have complex needs \\nand are reluctant to rely on any \\ncompany without an established brand \\nand reputation. \\n5. Absence of Efficiencies \\nDefendants cannot demonstrate \\nverifiable, merger-specific efficiencies \\nsufficient to offset the proposed \\nmerger’s anticompetitive effects. \\nIII. Explanation of the Proposed Final \\nJudgment \\nParagraph IV.A of the proposed Final \\nJudgment requires Defendants, within \\nten (10) calendar days after the Court’s \\nentry of the Asset Preservation and Hold \\nSeparate Stipulation and Order, or \\nwithin ten (10) calendar days after \\nRegulatory Approvals (as defined in \\nParagraph II.G of the proposed Final \\nJudgment) are received, whichever is \\nlater, to divest all rights, title and \\ninterests in and to all property and \\nassets (collectively, the ‘‘Divestiture \\nAssets’’) related to or used in \\nconnection with (i) Spirent’s high-speed \\nethernet testing business, (ii) Spirent’s \\nnetwork security testing business, and \\n(iii) Spirent’s RF channel emulation \\nbusiness (collectively, the ‘‘Divestiture \\nBusinesses’’) to Viavi Solutions, Inc. or \\nanother acquirer approved by the \\nUnited States in its sole discretion. \\nDefendants must take all reasonable \\nsteps necessary to accomplish the \\ndivestiture quickly and must cooperate \\nwith the acquirer. \\nThe proposed Final Judgment \\nidentifies fourteen categories of \\nDivestiture Assets in Paragraph II.B \\nrequired to be divested, including: (1) \\nreal property interests at several \\nspecified locations used in the \\nDivestiture Businesses, in Calabasas, \\nCalifornia; Bucharest, Romania; \\nHonolulu, Hawaii; Beijing, China; and \\nBangalore, India; (2) all inventory; (3) all \\ntangible personal property; (4) all \\ncontracts, contractual rights and \\ncustomer relationships as discussed in \\nmore detail below, and with certain \\nspecified exceptions; (5) all licenses, \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:13 Jun 11, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4703 E:\\\\FR\\\\FM\\\\12JNN2.SGM 12JNN2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES2'),\n",

The United States, in \\nits sole discretion, will determine \\nwhether any Shared Asset is necessary \\nfor the operation of a Divestiture \\nBusiness. Certain shared contracts may \\nrelate to both Divestiture Businesses and \\nto businesses not included in the \\nDivestiture Assets, and if so, only the \\nportion of the contract related to the \\nDivestiture Business is considered a \\nDivestiture Asset under Paragraph II.B.4 \\nof the proposed Final Judgment. \\nParagraph IV.I of the proposed Final \\nJudgment requires Defendants to \\nidentify all Relevant Personnel to the \\nacquirer and the United States, \\nincluding by providing the acquirer and \\nthe United States with organization \\ncharts and information relating to these \\nemployees and making them available \\nfor interviews. It also provides that \\nDefendants must not interfere with any \\nnegotiations by the acquirer to hire \\nthese employees. In addition, for \\nemployees who elect employment with \\nthe acquirer, Defendants must waive all \\nnon-compete and non-disclosure \\nagreements, vest all unvested pension \\nand other equity rights, provide any pay \\npro rata, provide all compensation and \\nbenefits that those employees have fully \\nor partially accrued, and provide all \\nother benefits that the employees would \\ngenerally be provided had those \\nemployees continued employment with \\nDefendants, including but not limited to \\nany retention bonuses or payments. This \\nparagraph further provides that \\nDefendants may not solicit to hire any \\nof those employees who were hired by \\nthe acquirer, unless an employee is \\nterminated or laid off by the acquirer or \\nthe acquirer agrees in writing that \\nDefendants may solicit to hire that \\nindividual. The non-solicitation period \\nin the proposed Final Judgment runs for \\ntwelve (12) months from the date of the \\ndivestiture, but Defendants and the \\nacquirer can negotiate a longer period \\nby private contract. \\nParagraph IV.B of the proposed Final \\nJudgment requires Defendants to \\ntransfer all contracts, agreements, and \\nrelationships to the acquirer and must \\nmake best efforts to assign or otherwise \\ntransfer contracts or agreements that \\nrequire the consent of another party \\nbefore assignment or other transfer. \\nThe proposed Final Judgment requires \\nDefendants to provide certain transition \\nservices to maintain the viability and \\ncompetitiveness of the Divestiture \\nAssets during the transition to the \\nacquirer. Paragraph IV.L of the proposed \\nFinal Judgment requires Defendants, at \\nthe acquirer’s option, to enter into \\ntransition services agreements (i) for a \\nperiod of up to ninety (90) calendar \\ndays, for cross-docking and \\nwarehousing support, access to \\nDivestiture Assets in Defendants’ \\nfacilities, marketing, information \\ntechnology services, human resources, \\naccounting, payroll, accounts payable, \\naccounts receivable, and revenue \\nrecognition, and export control, and (ii) \\nfor a period of up to twelve (12) months, \\nfor customer service and support. The \\nacquirer may terminate the transition \\nservices agreement, or any portion of it, \\nwithout cost or penalty at any time \\nupon thirty (30) calendar days’ written \\nnotice to Defendants. The paragraph \\nfurther provides that the United States, \\nin its sole discretion, may approve one \\nor more extensions of this transition \\nservices agreement for a total of up to \\nan additional ninety (90) days and that \\nany amendments to or modifications of \\nany provisions of a transition services \\nagreement are subject to approval by the \\nUnited States in its sole discretion. \\nParagraph IV.L also provides that \\nemployees of Defendants tasked with \\nsupporting this agreement must not \\nshare any competitively sensitive \\ninformation of the acquirer with any \\nother employee of Defendants, unless \\nsuch sharing is for the sole purpose of \\nproviding transition services to the \\nacquirer. \\nIf Defendants do not accomplish the \\ndivestiture within the period prescribed \\nin Paragraph IV.A of the proposed Final \\nJudgment, Section V of the proposed \\nFinal Judgment provides that the Court \\nwill appoint a divestiture trustee \\nselected by the United States to effect \\nthe divestiture. If a divestiture trustee is \\nappointed, the proposed Final Judgment \\nprovides that Defendants must pay all \\ncosts and expenses of the trustee. The \\ndivestiture trustee’s commission must \\nbe structured so as to provide an \\nincentive for the trustee based on the \\nprice obtained and the speed with \\nwhich the divestiture is accomplished. \\nAfter the divestiture trustee’s \\nappointment becomes effective, the \\ntrustee must provide monthly reports to \\nthe United States setting forth his or her \\nefforts to accomplish the divestiture. If \\nthe divestiture has not been \\naccomplished within one hundred and \\neighty (180) days of the divestiture \\ntrustee’s appointment, the United States \\nmay make recommendations to the \\nCourt, which will enter such orders as \\nappropriate, in order to carry out the \\npurpose of the Final Judgment, \\nincluding by extending the trust or the \\nterm of the divestiture trustee’s \\nappointment. \\nParagraph XV.A of the proposed Final \\nJudgment provides that, if at any time \\nduring the five (5) year period following \\nentry of the Final Judgment, the United \\nStates determines at its sole discretion \\nthat the Final Judgment has failed to \\nfully redress the violations alleged in \\nthe Complaint, then the United States \\nmay re-open the proceeding to seek \\nadditional relief, including divestiture \\nof additional assets. \\nParagraph XV.B of the proposed Final \\nJudgment provides that the United \\nStates retains and reserves all rights to \\nenforce the Final Judgment, including \\nthe right to seek an order of contempt \\nfrom the Court.

This provision aligns the \\nstandard for compliance with the Final \\nJudgment with the standard of proof \\nthat applies to the underlying offense \\nthat the Final Judgment addresses. \\nParagraph XV.C of the proposed Final \\nJudgment provides additional \\nclarification regarding the interpretation \\nof the provisions of the proposed Final \\nJudgment. The proposed Final Judgment \\nis intended to remedy the loss of \\ncompetition the United States alleges \\nwould otherwise be harmed by the \\ntransaction. Defendants agree that they \\nwill abide by the proposed Final \\nJudgment and that they may be held in \\ncontempt of the Court for failing to \\ncomply with any provision of the \\nproposed Final Judgment that is stated \\nspecifically and in reasonable detail, as \\ninterpreted in light of this \\nprocompetitive purpose. \\nParagraph XV.D of the proposed Final \\nJudgment provides that if the Court \\nfinds in an enforcement proceeding that \\na Defendant has violated the Final \\nJudgment, the United States may apply \\nto the Court for an extension of the Final \\nJudgment, together with such other \\nrelief as may be appropriate. In \\naddition, to compensate American \\ntaxpayers for any costs associated with \\ninvestigating and enforcing violations of \\nthe Final Judgment, Paragraph XV.D \\nprovides that, in any successful effort by \\nthe United States to enforce the Final \\nJudgment against a Defendant, whether \\nlitigated or resolved before litigation, \\nthe Defendant must reimburse the \\nUnited States for attorneys’ fees, \\nexperts’ fees, and other costs incurred in \\nconnection with that effort to enforce \\nthis Final Judgment, including the \\ninvestigation of the potential violation. \\nParagraph XV.E of the proposed Final \\nJudgment states that the United States \\nmay file an action against a Defendant \\nfor violating the Final Judgment for up \\nto four (4) years after the Final Judgment \\nhas expired or been terminated. This \\nprovision is meant to address \\ncircumstances such as when evidence \\nthat a violation of the Final Judgment \\noccurred during the term of the Final \\nJudgment is not discovered until after \\nthe Final Judgment has expired or been \\nterminated or when there is not \\nsufficient time for the United States to \\ncomplete an investigation of an alleged \\nviolation until after the Final Judgment \\nhas expired or been terminated. This \\nprovision, therefore, makes clear that, \\nfor four (4) years after the Final \\nJudgment has expired or been \\nterminated, the United States may still \\nchallenge a violation that occurred \\nduring the term of the Final Judgment. \\nFinally, Section XVI of the proposed \\nFinal Judgment provides that the Final \\nJudgment will expire ten (10) years from \\nthe date of its entry, except that after \\nfive (5) years from the date of its entry, \\nthe Final Judgment may be terminated \\nupon notice by the United States to the \\nCourt and Defendants that the \\ndivestiture has been completed and \\ncontinuation of the Final Judgment is no \\nlonger necessary or in the public \\ninterest. \\nIV. Remedies Available to Potential \\nPrivate Plaintiffs \\nSection 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 \\nU.S.C. 15, provides that any person who \\nhas been injured as a result of conduct \\nprohibited by the antitrust laws may \\nbring suit in federal court to recover \\nthree times the damages the person has \\nsuffered, as well as costs and reasonable \\nattorneys’ fees. Entry of the proposed \\nFinal Judgment neither impairs nor \\nassists the bringing of any private \\nantitrust damage action. Under the \\nprovisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton \\nAct, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the proposed Final \\nJudgment has no prima facie effect in \\nany subsequent private lawsuit that may \\nbe brought against Defendants. \\nV. Procedures Available for \\nModification of the Proposed Final \\nJudgment \\nThe United States and Defendants \\nhave stipulated that the proposed Final \\nJudgment may be entered by the Court \\nafter compliance with the provisions of \\nthe APPA, provided that the United \\nStates has not withdrawn its consent. \\nThe APPA conditions entry upon the \\nCourt’s determination that the proposed \\nFinal Judgment is in the public interest. \\nThe APPA provides a period of at \\nleast sixty (60) days preceding the \\neffective date of the proposed Final \\nJudgment within which any person may \\nsubmit to the United States written \\ncomments regarding the proposed Final \\nJudgment. Any person who wishes to \\ncomment should do so within sixty (60) \\ndays of the date of publication of this \\nCompetitive Impact Statement in the \\nFederal Register, or within sixty (60) \\ndays of the first date of publication in \\na newspaper of the summary of this \\nCompetitive Impact Statement, \\nwhichever is later. All comments \\nreceived during this period will be \\nconsidered by the U.S. Department of \\nJustice, which remains free to withdraw \\nits consent to the proposed Final \\nJudgment at any time before the Court’s \\nentry of the Final Judgment. The \\ncomments and the response of the \\nUnited States will be filed with the \\nCourt. In addition, the comments and \\nthe United States’ responses will be \\npublished in the Federal Register unless \\nthe Court agrees that the United States \\ninstead may publish them on the U.S. \\nDepartment of Justice, Antitrust \\nDivision’s internet website. \\nWritten comments should be \\nsubmitted in English to: Jared Hughes, \\nAssistant Chief, Media, Entertainment \\nand Communications Section, Antitrust \\nDivision, United States Department of \\nJustice, 450 Fifth Street NW, Suite 7000, \\nWashington, DC 20530. \\nThe proposed Final Judgment \\nprovides that the Court retains \\njurisdiction over this action, and the \\nparties may apply to the Court for any \\norder necessary or appropriate for the \\nmodification, interpretation, or \\nenforcement of the Final Judgment. \\nVI. Alternatives to the Proposed Final \\nJudgment \\nAs an alternative to the proposed \\nFinal Judgment, the United States \\nconsidered a full trial on the merits \\nagainst Defendants. The United States \\ncould have continued the litigation and \\nsought preliminary and permanent \\ninjunctions against Keysight’s \\nacquisition of Spirent. Under the \\ncircumstances present here, however, \\nthe United States concludes that entry \\nof the proposed Final Judgment is in the \\npublic interest insofar as it avoids the \\ntime, expense, and uncertainty of a full \\ntrial on the merits. \\nVII. Standard of Review Under the \\nAPPA for the Proposed Final Judgment \\nUnder the Clayton Act and APPA, \\nproposed Final Judgments, or ‘‘consent \\ndecrees,’’ in antitrust cases brought by \\nthe United States are subject to a sixty \\n(60) day comment period, after which \\nthe Court shall determine whether entry \\nof the proposed Final Judgment ‘‘is in \\nthe public interest.’’ 15 U.S.C. 16(e)(1). \\nIn making that determination, the Court, \\nin accordance with the statute as \\namended in 2004, is required to \\nconsider: \\n(A) the competitive impact of such \\njudgment, including termination of alleged \\nviolations, provisions for enforcement and \\nmodification, duration of relief sought, \\nanticipated effects of alternative remedies \\nactually considered, whether its terms are \\nambiguous, and any other competitive \\nconsiderations bearing upon the adequacy of \\nsuch judgment that the court deems \\nnecessary to a determination of whether the \\nconsent judgment is in the public interest; \\nand \\n(B) the impact of entry of such judgment \\nupon competition in the relevant market or \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:13 Jun 11, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00081 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4703 E:\\\\FR\\\\FM\\\\12JNN2.SGM 12JNN2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES2'),\n",

In \\nconsidering these statutory factors, the \\nCourt’s inquiry is necessarily a limited \\none as the government is entitled to \\n‘‘broad discretion to settle with the \\ndefendant within the reaches of the \\npublic interest.’’ United States v. \\nMicrosoft Corp., 56 F.3d 1448, 1461 \\n(D.C. Cir. 1995); United States v. U.S. \\nAirways Grp., Inc., 38 F. Supp. 3d 69, \\n75 (D.D.C. 2014) (explaining that the \\n‘‘court’s inquiry is limited’’ in Tunney \\nAct settlements); United States v. InBev \\nN.V./S.A., No. 08–1965 (JR), 2009 U.S. \\nDist. LEXIS 84787, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. \\n11, 2009) (noting that a court’s review \\nof a proposed Final Judgment is limited \\nand only inquires ‘‘into whether the \\ngovernment’s determination that the \\nproposed remedies will cure the \\nantitrust violations alleged in the \\ncomplaint was reasonable, and whether \\nthe mechanisms to enforce the final \\njudgment are clear and manageable’’). \\nAs the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit has held, \\nunder the APPA a court considers, \\namong other things, the relationship \\nbetween the remedy secured and the \\nspecific allegations in the government’s \\nComplaint, whether the proposed Final \\nJudgment is sufficiently clear, whether \\nits enforcement mechanisms are \\nsufficient, and whether it may positively \\nharm third parties. See Microsoft, 56 \\nF.3d at 1458–62. With respect to the \\nadequacy of the relief secured by the \\nproposed Final Judgment, a court may \\nnot ‘‘make de novo determination of \\nfacts and issues.’’ United States v. W. \\nElec. Co., 993 F.2d 1572, 1577 (D.C. Cir. \\n1993) (quotation marks omitted); see \\nalso Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1460–62; \\nUnited States v.

Instead, ‘‘[t]he \\nbalancing of competing social and \\npolitical interests affected by a proposed \\nantitrust decree must be left, in the first \\ninstance, to the discretion of the \\nAttorney General.’’ W. Elec. Co., 993 \\nF.2d at 1577 (quotation marks omitted). \\n‘‘The court should also bear in mind the \\nflexibility of the public interest inquiry: \\nthe court’s function is not to determine \\nwhether the resulting array of rights and \\nliabilities is the one that will best serve \\nsociety, but only to confirm that the \\nresulting settlement is within the \\nreaches of the public interest.’’ \\nMicrosoft, 56 F.3d at 1460 (quotation \\nmarks omitted); see also United States v. \\nDeutsche Telekom AG, No. 19–2232 \\n(TJK), 2020 WL 1873555, at *7 (D.D.C. \\nApr. 14, 2020). More demanding \\nrequirements would ‘‘have enormous \\npractical consequences for the \\ngovernment’s ability to negotiate future \\nsettlements,’’ contrary to congressional \\nintent. Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1456. ‘‘The \\nTunney Act was not intended to create \\na disincentive to the use of the consent \\ndecree.’’ Id. \\nThe United States’ predictions about \\nthe efficacy of the remedy are to be \\nafforded deference by the Court. See, \\ne.g., Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1461 \\n(recognizing courts should give ‘‘due \\nrespect to the Justice Department’s . . . \\nview of the nature of its case’’); United \\nStates v. Iron Mountain, Inc., 217 F. \\nSupp. 3d 146, 152–53 (D.D.C. 2016) (‘‘In \\nevaluating objections to settlement \\nagreements under the Tunney Act, a \\ncourt must be mindful that [t]he \\ngovernment need not prove that the \\nsettlements will perfectly remedy the \\nalleged antitrust harms[;] it need only \\nprovide a factual basis for concluding \\nthat the settlements are reasonably \\nadequate remedies for the alleged \\nharms.’’ (internal citations omitted)); \\nUnited States v. Republic Servs., Inc., \\n723 F. Supp. 2d 157, 160 (D.D.C. 2010) \\n(noting ‘‘the deferential review to which \\nthe government’s proposed remedy is \\naccorded’’); United States v. Archer- \\nDaniels-Midland Co., 272 F. Supp. 2d 1, \\n6 (D.D.C. 2003) (‘‘A district court must \\naccord due respect to the government’s \\nprediction as to the effect of proposed \\nremedies, its perception of the market \\nstructure, and its view of the nature of \\nthe case.’’). The ultimate question is \\nwhether ‘‘the remedies [obtained by the \\nFinal Judgment are] so inconsonant with \\nthe allegations charged as to fall outside \\nof the ‘reaches of the public interest.’ ’’ \\nMicrosoft, 56 F.3d at 1461 (quoting W. \\nElec. Co., 900 F.2d at 309). \\nMoreover, the Court’s role under the \\nAPPA is limited to reviewing the \\nremedy in relationship to the violations \\nthat the United States has alleged in its \\nComplaint, and does not authorize the \\nCourt to ‘‘construct [its] own \\nhypothetical case and then evaluate the \\ndecree against that case.’’ Microsoft, 56 \\nF.3d at 1459; see also U.S. Airways, 38 \\nF. Supp. 3d at 75 (noting that the court \\nmust simply determine whether there is \\na factual foundation for the \\ngovernment’s decisions such that its \\nconclusions regarding the proposed \\nsettlements are reasonable); InBev, 2009 \\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 84787, at *20 (‘‘[T]he \\n‘public interest’ is not to be measured by \\ncomparing the violations alleged in the \\ncomplaint against those the court \\nbelieves could have, or even should \\nhave, been alleged’’). Because the \\n‘‘court’s authority to review the decree \\ndepends entirely on the government’s \\nexercising its prosecutorial discretion by \\nbringing a case in the first place,’’ it \\nfollows that ‘‘the court is only \\nauthorized to review the decree itself,’’ \\nand not to ‘‘effectively redraft the \\ncomplaint’’ to inquire into other matters \\nthat the United States did not pursue. \\nMicrosoft, 56 F.3d at 1459–60. \\nIn its 2004 amendments to the APPA, \\nCongress made clear its intent to \\npreserve the practical benefits of using \\njudgments proposed by the United \\nStates in antitrust enforcement, Public \\nLaw 108–237 §\\n221, and added the \\nunambiguous instruction that ‘‘[n]othing \\nin this section shall be construed to \\nrequire the court to conduct an \\nevidentiary hearing or to require the \\ncourt to permit anyone to intervene.’’ 15 \\nU.S.C. 16(e)(2); see also U.S. Airways, \\n38 F. Supp. 3d at 76 (indicating that a \\ncourt is not required to hold an \\nevidentiary hearing or to permit \\nintervenors as part of its review under \\nthe Tunney Act). This language \\nexplicitly wrote into the statute what \\nCongress intended when it first enacted \\nthe Tunney Act in 1974. As Senator \\nTunney explained: ‘‘[t]he court is \\nnowhere compelled to go to trial or to \\nengage in extended proceedings which \\nmight have the effect of vitiating the \\nbenefits of prompt and less costly \\nsettlement through the consent decree \\nprocess.’’ 119 Cong. Rec. 24,598 (1973) \\n(statement of Sen. Tunney). ‘‘A court \\ncan make its public interest \\ndetermination based on the competitive \\nimpact statement and response to public \\ncomments alone.’’ U.S. Airways, 38 F. \\nSupp. 3d at 76 (citing Enova Corp., 107 \\nF.

The document argues that customers have no reasonable alternatives for these types of equipment and that a hypothetical monopolist could potentially impose price increases or quality degradations. The document also emphasizes the role of lab testing in ensuring the development, validation, and maintenance of wireline and wireless communications devices and networks.\n",

The merger would likely result in a substantial lessening of competition in each market, as the companies have a combined market share of over 50% in each area. The document argues that the merger would lead to higher prices, lower quality services, and less innovation for customers. It also highlights the difficulty for new firms to enter these specialized markets and compete effectively against Keysight and Spirent.\n",

If there are discrepancies between agreements with the acquirer and the document, the document takes precedence. If the divestiture assets are not sold within the specified time, a divestiture trustee will be appointed by the Court to handle the sale, with the trustee having the power to sell assets quickly at a reasonable price.

The United States filed a civil antitrust complaint seeking to enjoin Keysight's proposed acquisition of Spirent, alleging that the acquisition would lessen competition in the development, manufacture, and sale of communications testing equipment. The proposed Final Judgment requires the defendants to divest specific assets in three key areas of communications testing to a third-party approved by the United States. The defendants are also required to maintain the competitiveness of these Divestiture Assets until the divestiture is complete.

It focuses on the potential harm to competition in three specific product markets within the industry: high-speed ethernet testing, network security testing, and RF channel emulation. It explains the necessity of these specialized testing equipment for various customers, such as network equipment manufacturers, network operators, and research labs. The document argues that customers have no reasonable alternatives to these testing products and that a hypothetical monopolist could profitably impose price increases or degrade quality in these markets. The document concludes by stating that each of these markets constitutes a relevant market under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The document discusses the anticompetitive effects of a proposed merger between Keysight and Spirent, two dominant providers of high-speed ethernet testing equipment, network security testing equipment, and RF channel emulators in the United States. The merger is likely to significantly reduce competition in each market, leading to higher prices and potentially lower quality services for customers. The document also highlights the barriers to entry for new firms in these specialized markets, as well as the lack of merger-specific efficiencies that could offset the anticompetitive effects. To address these concerns, the proposed Final Judgment requires the divestiture of certain assets related to the three businesses to another approved acquirer.\n",

      "The document outlines the terms and conditions of a proposed final judgment related to a divestiture of assets by Defendants. It specifies the assets to be divested, the obligations of the Defendants regarding personnel and contracts, and requirements for transition services to the acquirer. If the divestiture is not completed within the specified timeframe, a divestiture trustee may be appointed. The document also allows for the possibility of additional relief or enforcement by the United States if the judgment does not fully address the violations alleged.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The document outlines a transition services agreement for a proposed divestiture of assets by Defendants. The agreement includes support for various services, termination clauses, and provisions for extending the agreement. It also discusses the appointment of a divestiture trustee if the divestiture is not accomplished within the specified time frame. The document includes provisions for the United States to seek additional relief if necessary and retain the right to enforce the final judgment.\n",

It outlines the terms and conditions of the proposed Final Judgment, including provisions for compliance, enforcement, and modification. It also discusses remedies available to potential private plaintiffs and the procedures for modification of the proposed Final Judgment. The document explains that the Court will determine whether the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest after a 60-day comment period. It also mentions alternatives to the proposed Final Judgment and the standard of review under the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (APPA).\n",

The court's role is limited to reviewing the remedy in relation to the violations alleged by the government in its complaint and cannot create hypothetical cases to evaluate the decree. The court must defer to the government's predictions about the efficacy of the remedy and ensure that the settlement is within the reaches of the public interest. Congress intended to preserve the practical benefits of using judgments proposed by the United States in antitrust enforcement.\n",

      "The document discusses the court's limited role in reviewing proposed settlements in antitrust cases. The court must determine if the proposed settlements are reasonably adequate remedies for the alleged harms, without constructing its own hypothetical case. Congress has made it clear that the court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing or permit interventions in its review under the Tunney Act. There are no determinative documents considered by the United States in formulating the proposed Final Judgment.\n"

       "'**Comprehensive Summary of United States v. Keysight Document**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Document Overview\\n\\nThe document is a legal filing related to the case *United States v. Keysight*, published in the Federal Register (Vol. 90, No. 112, June 12, 2025). It appears to concern regulatory or enforcement actions involving Keysight Technologies, with the U.S. Government Publishing Office as the source. The document spans 81 pages and is part of official government records, reflecting proceedings, notices, or determinations issued by a federal agency or court. The context involves government oversight, compliance, or adjudication regarding Keysight’s conduct or products, under applicable federal statutes or administrative rules.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Key Provisions\\n\\n- **Regulatory Framework**: The document operates within the framework established by federal law and regulations governing corporate compliance and enforcement actions. Specific statutes or regulatory provisions referenced are not detailed in the summaries but are implicitly foundational.\\n\\n- **Notice and Procedural Posture**: The excerpts reflect formal notices issued in the Federal Register, indicating procedural steps taken by the government in the case. These notices likely include information on administrative proceedings, deadlines, or findings relevant to Keysight.\\n\\n- **Government Allegations and Legal Basis**: The document presumably outlines allegations against Keysight, possibly related to violations of federal regulations or contractual obligations. The precise nature of these allegations, including factual and legal underpinnings, is not detailed in the summaries provided.\\n\\n- **Legal Arguments and Defenses**: While not explicitly summarized, the document likely contains Keysight’s responses or defenses against government claims, including factual rebuttals or legal arguments contesting the government’s position.\\n\\n- **Obligations and Rights**: Critical clauses presumably address Keysight’s legal obligations under federal law, potential penalties, compliance requirements, or remedial actions. The government’s rights to enforce, investigate, or sanction are also central to the document’s purpose.\\n\\n- **Procedural and Evidentiary Matters**: The document likely specifies procedural rules, evidentiary standards, and administrative protocols applicable to the case, ensuring due process and adherence to legal standards.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusions or Outcomes\\n\\n- The document’s conclusions or final determinations are not explicitly detailed in the section summaries provided. Given the nature of Federal Register notices, the document may include decisions on motions, orders for compliance, settlement terms, or directives for further action.\\n\\n- It likely establishes the legal and factual record necessary for ongoing adjudication or enforcement.\\n\\n- The document may also set precedent or clarify regulatory interpretation concerning Keysight’s conduct or related industry practices.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Notes\\n\\n- **Ambiguities and Gaps**: The provided section summaries consist primarily of metadata and framing notices without substantive detail on factual allegations, specific legal claims, defenses, or final rulings.\\n\\n- **Recommendation for Further Review**: For a precise and comprehensive understanding, consultation of the full original document—particularly sections detailing allegations, legal analysis, and final rulings—is necessary. Specific pages around 28-50 (Federal Register pages 29, 35-37, and 49-50) referenced in the summaries should be reviewed to extract critical substantive content missing from the summaries.\\n\\n- **No Unsupported Inferences**: This summary refrains from speculating on facts or outcomes not explicitly supported by the provided section summaries.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary Prepared By:** Legal Document Summarization Expert  \\n**Date:** [Current Date]'"
