# Masters Coding Projects

Welcome to my Master's project portfolio! This repository showcases my work from my Master's program, focusing on **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Big Data Analysis**. It contains over 50 datasets and models, with large files (up to 510 MB) managed using Git Large File Storage (LFS). This repo demonstrates my skills in data science, model development, and large-scale data processing, organized by subject for easy exploration.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: A collection of coding projects from my Master's degree, designed to showcase technical proficiency and practical applications.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, TensorFlow/PyTorch (inferred from model files), Pandas, Git LFS.
- **Size**: Over 2.4 GB of data, including datasets and trained models.

## Subjects
- **[Artificial Intelligence](./Artificial%20Intelligence)**: NLP datasets, model checkpoints, and AI experiments.
- **[Big Data Analysis](./Big%20data%20Analysis)**: Large-scale datasets and analysis scripts for real-world data.
- **[Machine Learning](./Machine%20Learning)**: Predictive models, fraud detection, and customer segmentation projects.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbhisheKDhanani11/Masters-Coding-Projects.git
