## Artificial Intelligence Projects

This folder contains my Artificial Intelligence projects from my Master's program, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning.

### Contents
- **Datasets**: Collections of text data for NLP tasks, such as news articles for classification or generation.
- **Model Checkpoints**: Trained deep learning models and their training states, including optimizer settings and utilities.

### Purpose
- **NLP Analysis**: Experiments with text classification or generation tasks.
- **Deep Learning**: Training and fine-tuning large models, likely using PyTorch or TensorFlow.

### Usage
1. **Requirements**: Install PyTorch (`pip install torch`) and other dependencies as needed.
2. **Load Models**: Use PyTorch to load trained models for inference or further training.
3. **Datasets**: Process text datasets with Pandas or NLP libraries for analysis.

### Notes
- Large files require Git LFS (`git lfs pull`).
- Models may need specific architectures (e.g., transformers like BERT or GPT) to load correctly.
