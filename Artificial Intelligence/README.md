# Artificial Intelligence Projects

This folder contains my Artificial Intelligence projects from my Master's program, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning models.

## Contents
- **Dataset/archive/**:
  - `Fake.csv` (59.88 MB): Dataset of fake news articles for NLP tasks.
  - `True.csv` (51.08 MB): Dataset of true news articles for comparison.
- **results/**:
  - `checkpoint-3929/`:
    - `model.safetensors` (255.43 MB): Trained model checkpoint (likely a transformer).
    - `optimizer.pt` (510.91 MB): Optimizer state for the model.
    - `scaler.pt`, `scheduler.pt`: Training utilities.
  - `checkpoint-625/`:
    - Same structure as above, likely an earlier training iteration.

## Purpose
- **NLP Analysis**: Experiments with fake/true news classification or text generation.
- **Deep Learning**: Training and fine-tuning large models, possibly using PyTorch or TensorFlow.

## Usage
1. **Requirements**: Install PyTorch (`pip install torch`) and other dependencies as needed.
2. **Load Models**:
   ```python
   import torch
   model = torch.load("checkpoint-3929/model.safetensors")
