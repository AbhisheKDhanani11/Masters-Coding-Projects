## Database Management Projects

This folder contains my Database Management projects from my Master's program, focusing on designing and implementing a relational database system for inventory management.

### Contents
- **Database Scripts**: SQL scripts for creating and managing the database, including table creation, user setup, data insertion, and report generation.
- **Reports**: Predefined reports tailored for various user roles, providing insights into inventory, sales, and supplier data.

### Purpose
- **Inventory Management**: Building a scalable database to track products, suppliers, stores, stock levels, and sales transactions.
- **Data Analysis**: Generating role-specific reports to support decision-making for store managers, suppliers, and other stakeholders.

### Usage
1. **Requirements**: Install a SQL database system like Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL, along with a SQL client (e.g., SQL*Plus, MySQL Workbench).
2. **Setup Database**: Execute the provided SQL scripts in the correct order to set up the database, tables, and data.
3. **Run Reports**: Use SQL queries to generate reports for inventory tracking, sales analysis, or supplier management.

### Notes
- Ensure the database path is updated in the setup scripts before execution.
- Follow the setup instructions carefully to avoid errors during database creation.
