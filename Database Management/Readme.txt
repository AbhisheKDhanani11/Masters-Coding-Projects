Hello i hope you are doing well,

I have created this Database on store inventory management system.

To run the project success fully follow the steps.

	1) change the path for the DB file in createTablespace.sql file.
	2) run createTablespace.sql to create the database.
	3) run createUser.sql to and grant the permission to use the tablespace.
	4) run the createTables.sql file to create all the tables.
	5) run the insert.sql file to insert all the values into tables.
	6) run any report you want to see. 

all the reports file start with the name Repg_xxxxxx.
use dropTable.sql incase you want to delete all the tables. 

Thank you.
