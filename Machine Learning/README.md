# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects and assignments completed during my master's program. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.

## Overview

The repository includes various Jupyter notebooks and scripts that demonstrate the implementation of key machine learning concepts. Some of the areas covered include:

- **Supervised Learning:** Regression and classification tasks using traditional ML algorithms (e.g., decision trees, XGBoost, LightGBM).
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering techniques such as K-Means.
- **Deep Learning:** Neural network-based solutions for classification and regression.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Sentiment analysis, text classification, and other NLP applications.
- **Data Science Tools & Techniques:** Hands-on projects exploring data visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
