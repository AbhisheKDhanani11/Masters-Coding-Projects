## Big Data Analysis Projects

This folder houses my Big Data Analysis projects, featuring large-scale data processing and analysis of real-world datasets.

### Contents
- **Datasets**: Extensive collections of real-world data, including housing, traffic, health, and economic datasets.
- **Analysis Scripts**: Code for cleaning, processing, and analyzing large datasets, along with some duplicate data for specific analyses.

### Purpose
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and transforming large datasets for analysis.
- **Insights**: Extracting trends and patterns, such as housing market trends or public health impacts.

### Usage
1. **Requirements**: Python, Pandas (`pip install pandas`), and possibly Spark for large-scale processing.
2. **Analysis**: Use Python scripts to load and analyze datasets, exploring trends and insights.
3. **Extract Archives**: Some data may be in compressed formats; extract them using tools like `tar`.

### Notes
- Some data appears in multiple subfoldersâ€”consider consolidating for clarity.
- Large files use Git LFS (`git lfs pull`).
