The sun rises every morning, bringing light to the world . The world spins on its axis , creating day and night . During the day , people go to work , while at night , they rest . The moon appears in the sky at night , casting its soft glow over the world . The stars twinkle in the night sky , reminding us of the vast universe beyond . The sun sets , marking the end of the day . Yet , the sun will rise again , and the cycle of day and night will continue , as it has for millions of years .
