## Intro to Python Projects

This folder contains my introductory Python projects from my Master's program, focusing on fundamental programming concepts and practical applications.

### Contents
- **Programs**: A collection of Python scripts demonstrating basic programming techniques, including user input handling, file operations, and object-oriented programming.
- **Text Data**: Sample text files used for input in various programs, such as numerical data processing.

### Purpose
- **Basic Programming**: Exploring core Python concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and classes.

### Usage
1. **Requirements**: Install Python and a code editor like VS Code or IDLE.
2. **Run Programs**: Execute Python scripts using a terminal or IDE (`python script.py`).
3. **Input Files**: Some programs require text files for input; ensure these files are in the same directory as the scripts.

### Notes
- These projects are beginner-level and focus on learning Python fundamentals.
- Ensure input files are properly formatted (e.g., numerical data for file processing scripts).
